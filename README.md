You can create your dietary plan and app will send you notifications with reminders ex. about shopping for next week.
It also gives you ability to  contact with other users and share your favourite recipes or plans.

If you want to use this code or try how it works - please create fork and clone it on your computer.

All expected modules are in requirements.txt file.

Create user, login and have fun.

_Warning! Automatic creating plan feature is simplified and not working as planned.
